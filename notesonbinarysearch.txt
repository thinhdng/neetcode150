is used to find an element position in a sorted array  (can't be used on unsorted arrays)
2 ways to implement:
    iterative
    recursive

iterative pseudocode:
do until the pointers low and high meet each other.
    mid = (low + high)/2
    if (x == arr[mid])
        return mid
    else if (x > arr[mid]) // x is on the right side
        low = mid + 1
    else                       // x is on the left side
        high = mid - 1

time complexity of binarySearch:
best case: O(1)
average case and worst case: O(lgn)
